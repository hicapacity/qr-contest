  An oscilloscope is an instrument used to test electrical circuits.
  It lets you observe signals which are varying in a graph.
  It shows voltage on the y-axis, and time on the x-axis.
  This oscilloscope is hooked up to the synthesizer.
  See what happens when you play different notes on the oscilloscope!
